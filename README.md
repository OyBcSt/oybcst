# Modeling connections between ecosystem condition and ecosystem services to increase resilience of environmental systems in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

There are mutiple components...

## Hydrodynamics
Modeling hydrodynamics allows us to estimate quantities like salinity and temperature in the absence of measured data.  
- For animations and details about grids, see: [Mobile Bay Hydrodynamics modeling](https://github.com/lisalenorelowe/oybcst-hydro).
- To compare modeled vs measured salinity and temperature, see our [interactive map of Mobile Bay](https://lisalenorelowe.shinyapps.io/shiny-mb/)

## Ecosystem modeling
Phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics depend on salinity, temperature, and nutrients.  See more about modeling biogeochemical processes with [CGEM (Coastal General Ecology Model)](https://github.com/lisalenorelowe/cgem-schism)
