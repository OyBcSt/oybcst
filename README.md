***Building Resilience to Environmental Trends and Variability in the Gulf of Mexico***

There are mutiple components, including

## Hydrodynamics modeling
Modeling hydrodynamics allows us to estimate quantities like salinity and temperature in the absence of measured data.  
- For animations and details about grids, see: [Mobile Bay Hydrodynamics modeling](https://github.com/OyBcSt/oybcst-hydro).
- To compare modeled vs measured salinity and temperature, see our [interactive map of Mobile Bay](https://lisalenorelowe.shinyapps.io/shiny-mb/)

## Ecosystem modeling
Phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics depend on salinity, temperature, and nutrients.  See more about modeling biogeochemical processes with [CGEM (Coastal General Ecology Model)](https://github.com/lisalenorelowe/cgem-schism)

## Fisheries analysis
Analysis of species data may be improved by using modeling data to fill gaps in measured data.  See:
- [Phenology of Fish and Inverebrates in Mobile Bay, AL](https://github.com/OyBcSt/oybcst-fish)
